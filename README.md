- ðŸ”­ We are currently working on our final Blue Badge project. We created an app called Wiki Tunez. It is a music app where you can search for artists, albums, and songs. As well as add those specifc songs into your own personal playlist. 
- Wiki Tunez is an n-tier api with mutliple classes, foreign keys, one to many relationships, a many to many relationship with a junction table, and endpoint descriptions. 
- You can search for different songs by the name or artist, search for an artist and get a list of albums and songs done by them, and add and delete specific songs from your playlist.

- ðŸŒ± This project helped us become more familiar with Git, API's, Entity Framework, and Postman.
